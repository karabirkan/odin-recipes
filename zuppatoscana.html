        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage

            </li>
            <li>1 Â¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes

            </li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces

            </li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced

            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly,
                browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.

            </p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a
                few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and
                garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

            </p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high
                heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir
                in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before
                serving.

            </p>
